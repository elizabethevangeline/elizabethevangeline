### Hi there 👋 I'm Elii

🎓 I'm currently a 3rd semester student at BINUS University with a strong interest in the world of data.
💻 My main focus is on Data Science and Data Analysis, where I love exploring datasets, cleaning messy data, and transforming them into meaningful insights.
📊 I believe that every dataset has a story, and my passion lies in uncovering those stories through analysis, visualization, and models.

I’ve been building my skills step by step — from mastering the basics of Python and SQL, to exploring visualization tools and diving into the foundations of Machine Learning & Deep Learning. I enjoy working on projects that combine technical skills with creativity, whether it’s analyzing real-world datasets, creating dashboards, or experimenting with predictive models.
